## Monogram

It is a simple set of two utility scripts that allow you to run programs as admin.

Essentially think of `monogram.exe` and `owca.exe` as equivalent to *nix `sudo` functionality.

A new shell is opened and console programs can be easily run.                   
In case of GUI programs, there's no shell, but the program runs easily.              

Since this is an AHK script that uses the `%A_Args` variable, the compiler must be of version `1.1.27` or above.
